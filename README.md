#the code runs only in linux. 
#in order to run it in windows you should remove the 'phylip' ('phylip neighbor' change to 'neighbor',  'phylip treedist' change  & 'treedist'). 
#in simulations : in order to run hp or dcj you should download UniMoG (https://bibiserv.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/dcj). 
#put UniMoG in same folder as the code. 

#you should have the input files in order to run the scripts.
